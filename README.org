** How to run the homework assignments
This project uses Poetry for package and venv management. After you get it
installed (using either brew or your neighborhood package manager, as per the
official docs), you only need to do the following things:

#+begin_src bash
poetry shell # to activate the virtual environment
poetry install
python3 -m ai_lab.lab_N # N ∈ $(seq -f "%02g" 1 14)
#+end_src

Optionally, you can also run the tests (although there aren't many) using either =pytest= or =python3 -m pytest=.

The Python version used here is Python 3.11.
